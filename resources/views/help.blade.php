	<p>Randomizing the game definitely tests your knowledge of the game! If you think you’re stuck try
		considering the below.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You can sneak through Agahnim's barrier with the Magic Cape if you don’t yet have an upgraded sword.</li>
		<li>You can reach Desert Palace without the Book of Mudora if you have access to the Misery Mire area in the
			Dark World and the Magic Mirror.</li>
		<li>You can use Bombos to burn things as well as the Fire Rod. This allows you to enter Ice Palace and
			defeat Kholdstare.</li>
		<li>You can cross small pits by bonking against walls/blocks if you have the Pegasus Boots. This may allow you
			to explore Misery Mire or the left wing of Ganon’s Tower without the Hookshot. You can also reach a treasure
			chest in Dark World Death Mountain with this trick.</li>
		<li>Sahasrahla requires the Pendant of Courage (the green one) irrespective of whether Eastern Palace has
			been completed.</li>
		<li>If you have the 5th and 6th crystal (which could be located in any dungeons) you can purchase the
			Super Bomb which grants you access to the Fat Faerie in the Pyramid of Power. Check your map to see
			where crystals are located!</li>
