	<p><strong>This is still in very early testing, so be prepared for some odd behaviour and possible random crashes.</strong></p>
	<br />
	<p>Welcome to the Super Metroid and A Link to the Past combined item randomizer.</p>
	<p>This randomizer mixes Super Metroid and A Link to the Past together into one experience and will randomize both games items to any location in either game creating a new kind of multi-game challenge.</p>
	<br />
	<p>Huge credits to the <strong><a href="https://vt.alttp.run">ALttP Randomizer</a></strong> team for much of the tools used for the randomization and for the ALttP randomization patches and logic.</p>
