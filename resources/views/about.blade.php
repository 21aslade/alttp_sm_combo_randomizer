	<p>Welcome to the Super Metroid and A Link to the Past crossover item randomizer.</p>
	<p>This randomizer mixes Super Metroid and A Link to the Past together into one experience and will randomize both games items to any location in either game creating a new kind of multi-game challenge. The goal is to kill both Ganon and Mother Brain and then finish either game.</p>
	<p>Travel between the two game can be done by using certain doors and entrances in either game, a list of those can be found in the document linked below.</p>
	<p>For some more information and resources about this randomizer, check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fP-DRbuROuQ-zifwKftuV-Paoh0_GGYErLGv3VVAg7Y/edit">this document</a>. There's also a discord server for this project at <a href="https://discord.gg/PMKcDPQ">https://discord.gg/PMKcDPQ</a></p>

	<p>This project is based on V29 of the <a href="http://vt.alttp.run">ALttP Randomizer</a> and the <a href="https://itemrando.supermetroid.run">Tournament SM Randomizer</a>, so being familiar with both of those will be helpful to be able to complete this.</p>
	<br />
	<p>Huge credits to the <strong><a href="http://vt.alttp.run">ALttP Randomizer</a></strong> team for much of the tools used for the randomization and for the ALttP randomization patches and logic.</p>
