<h2>Randomizer</h2>
<p>First and foremost, big thanks to Dessyreqt, Christos, and Karkat for their work.<p>
<p>Without their work none of this would even be remotely possible.</p>

<h2>Think You're Stuck?</h2>
<h4>Unable get all three pendants and can't get the Master Sword to enter Hyrule Castle Tower?</h4>
<p>Try using the cape to enter the tower instead of the Master Sword.</p>
<h4>No Book of Mudora to enter Desert Palace?</h4>
<p>If you have the Ocarina and Titan's Mitt, you can use that instead.</p>
<h4>No Fire Rod for use in the Ice Palace?</h4>
<p>Try the Bombos Medallion instead. It makes lots of fire.</p>
<h4>Need the Hookshot to enter Misery Mire?</h4>
<p>Try using the Pegasus Boots to charge into the block, jumping the gap with the recoil.</p>
