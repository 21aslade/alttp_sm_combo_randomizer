# ALttP PHP Randomizer

## First and foremost, big thanks to Dessyreqt and Karkat for their work.
### Without their work none of this would even be remotely possible.

### I wanted to create an API that modeled the Randomizer. This happened.

#### This is a port of the ALttP Randomizer "intended" to be a webservice.

#### Features include
* Randomization of Items including Boss Hearts, Swords, Crystals and Pendants.
* Tries to distrobute the items in a way as to not have everything way too early.
* Logic updates with the Boss Hearts and Dungeon Prize locations randomized.
* Ability to set custom Uncle Text.
* Ability to have Boss item in regular dungeon pool (Compass/Map/Keys)
* Documentation of classes and objects (paritally done).
* Ability to create as many "seeds" as you want.
* With a little logic create any seed with items in specific places (might take a while, or never finish if you are looking for dead locks).
